# Image-Processing-Using-OpenCV-and-Skimage
Image processing is a way to convert an image to a digital aspect and perform certain functions on it, in order to get an enhanced image or extract other useful information from it.

<h2>Why do we need Image processing?</h2> 
Image processing is most accurately described as a means of translation between a human viewing system and digital imaging devices.
A simple description of image processing refers to digital image processing, eg audio editing and any type of conflict that exists in the image using a digital computer.

<b>Image processing mainly involves the following three steps:</b>

1. Importing an image with image detection tools;
2. Exploring and manipulating the image;
3. An outcome where it can be improved or reported that is built on image analysis.

<h2>Steps in Image Processing</h2>
1. Image Acquisition: This word is commonly expected to accept processing, congestion, storage, printing, and display of such images. <br>
2. Image Enhancement: Image enhancement is a process of switching digital images to more results suitable for display or multiple image analysis. <br>
3. Image Restoration: The purpose of image restoration techniques is to reduce noise and reclaim the loss of decision.<br>
